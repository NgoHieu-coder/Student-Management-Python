# Student management project written in Python:

1. Introduction
    - This project is a Python console application, focuses on Data Structures and Algorithms, applys many data structures to student management.

2. Data Structures Explored

    2.1 Linked Lists
   
        - We re-build linked list from scratch and implement them in student list, subject list with CRUD features.
   
    2.2 AVL Trees
   
        - We re-build an AVL Tree from scratch and implement them in sorting and searching problem.
   
    2.3 Built-in Data Structures
   
        - This project also use a variety of built-in data structure, such as: list, tuple and dictionary
   
        - To manage grade, we custom a dictionary with key is a tuple of (roll, subject_id) and value is score. By doing this, we can fastly search for a grade based on key.
   
3. Conclusion:
   
    - This project provide us many new knowledge, especially about how to implement data structures in Python.
